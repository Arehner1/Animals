                <h2>Overview of the Tiger</h2>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species of the cat family. Native to Asia, they are known for their striking orange fur with black stripes. Tigers are apex predators and are solitary animals, often roaming large territories in search of food.</p>
                
                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Tigers are large and powerful, with males typically weighing between 400 to 670 pounds. Their muscular bodies, along with their sharp claws and teeth, make them incredibly effective hunters. Each tigerâ€™s pattern of stripes is unique, much like human fingerprints.</p>
                
                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>Tigers can be found in various habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps. They are primarily found in Asia, including countries like India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Tigers require dense vegetation to provide cover while hunting and marking their territory.</p>

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>Tigers are carnivores, and they hunt large prey such as deer, wild boar, and sometimes even smaller animals like rabbits. They are skilled hunters, often stalking their prey silently before launching a powerful attack. A tiger may hunt alone, using its strength and stealth to ambush prey.</p>

                <h3>Behavior</h3>
                <p>Tigers are solitary creatures and generally prefer to live alone, except during mating seasons or when a mother is raising her cubs. Tigers mark their territories with scent markings, making it clear to others that they are present. They are also known for their excellent swimming ability and are often seen near water sources, such as rivers and lakes.</p>

                <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
                <p>Sadly, tigers are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching for their beautiful fur, and the illegal wildlife trade. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these majestic creatures and preserve their habitats in the wild. The global population of tigers has drastically reduced over the years, but with efforts in wildlife preservation, there is hope for their future.</p>
